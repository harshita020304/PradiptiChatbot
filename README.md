IAA Project - Chatbot for Indian Aviation Academy (IAA)
Overview
This project provides an interactive chatbot for the Indian Aviation Academy (IAA) that assists users with inquiries related to available internships, courses, and general information. Built with a focus on user engagement, the chatbot offers a seamless experience to quickly access resources and opportunities within the aviation academy.

Technical Specifications
Architecture
The application is developed in Python, leveraging libraries and APIs for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data handling. The main components are:

Backend (app.py):

Manages the chatbot’s core logic, integrates NLP models, and interfaces with data resources to generate accurate responses.
Utilizes embeddings and other machine-learning techniques to match user queries to relevant information.
Map Integration (Mapbox API):

Uses the Mapbox API to visually represent cities where internship opportunities are available.
Enables interactive map functionality, allowing users to click on a city to reveal specific details about internships at that location.
Data and Retrieval (ChromaDB, Embeddings):

Embeds informational resources for efficient retrieval of content based on user queries.
ChromaDB acts as the vector database to manage and search embeddings for relevant answers.
Uses SentenceTransformer embeddings to convert text data into vector form for retrieval.
Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ajinkyamp777/IAA-Project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory. 
cd IAA-Project
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the chatbot application:
python app.py
